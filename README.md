## Description
GravBall is an interactive animation that demonstrates the effects of gravitational attraction on floating particles.  

## Project Design
GravBall was designed over a 5 day period in June, 2018.  Prior to being created a list of minimum viable products (MVPs) was formed to demonstrate a planning process before development began.  These MVPs were monitored to ensure I was staying on track to meet the final deadline.

## Key Features
* Gravitational attraction of every single gravity ball on free floating particles

* Gravity balls can collapse on each other to create a larger singular ball, the larger ball will always absorb the smaller one.

* Single click versus double click functionality

* Adjustable slider to set particle amount

## Technologies
GravBall was made using JavaScript was used to demonstrate its power with HTML5 and Canvas.  It did not incorporate any libraries, and is able to show off the capabilities of pure JavaScript.

## Future Plans
* Vectors
  * Implement a vector class to exert better control over particle attraction
* More GUI content
  * Interactive sliders for particle start size
  * Additional color sets
* Additional styling
  * Adjust colors
  * Particle and gravity ball shape
